```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## 🏗️ GitHub Actions CI

On every push/PR to `main`, the following workflow runs automatically:

- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Build project
- Lint code
- Run tests
- Build Docker image

File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

## 📦 Deployment

This app is Docker-ready.  
You can deploy using:

- Docker CLI
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (with a Deployment.yaml file)
- Any cloud provider like AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Web Apps
